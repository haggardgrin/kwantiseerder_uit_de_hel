# kwantiseerder_uit_de_hel

## Gate quantizer
or CV to clocked gate converter? Call it what you will!

6 channels, each has an input mixer with a pot providing DC offset. Any signal crossing 1v can be used as a clock source or gate source. Output bandwidth follows clock bandwidth. 

Could be expanded to 8 channels fairly easily if you so desire. Many other mods are possible and highly encouraged!  

If you have questions or problems or think of some good feature creep please message me at modwiggler or the AE modular forums both @haggardgrin 

Happy patching  :)
